Noob devs trying to do a website \o/

If you look on Trello you see what is already done / What there is to do, with an order of priority
You can assign yourself the components you want to do on the board I think, otherwise ask me and I would put you on
When you are working on something you swipe your card in the "In development" category
then in "Code Review" when you think you've finished
Then either Extern (Cieleia) or Root (if it is ok) go code review and tell you what is godd / what is not good
If everything is validated it goes to "Done" category and you can do an other component
There are png mockups on the cards, so you  can see what to do.
There is also a description for some. You can use Materialize to code
If you have a question don't hesitate to ask

Knowing that for the moment beauty / design level we don't care a bit, we'll see at the end, what we want for the moment is that it be functional
Also, if you need tournament logos / images etc, go to angular / assets / images.

You're not forced to use angular
You can just do HTML & CSS and I will transfer to angular myself
You can also use Materialize to help you
Its a framework CSS. 

To run angular on VSCode, open a new terminal and write 'ng serve --open'
